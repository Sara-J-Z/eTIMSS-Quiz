This is a simple quiz game that tests the user's knowledge with multiple-choice questions. The game consists of four pages:

1. **Page 1**: A welcome screen with a "Start" button to begin the quiz.
2. **Page 2**: The first multiple-choice question with four options.
3. **Page 3**: A question where the user selects multiple correct answers (factors of 12).
4. **Page 4**: The results page that shows the score based on the user's answers.

The goal of the game is to provide a simple, interactive way for users to answer questions and see their score at the end.

##  Next Steps: Planned Future Enhancements

These are extra features (stretch goals) I plan to explore in the future:

- **Add more questions**  
  Include more than two questions to make the quiz longer and more challenging.

-  **Improve styling and layout**  
  Use CSS Grid or Flexbox to make the quiz more responsive and visually appealing.

-  **Add a timer**  
  Limit the time a user has to answer each question, adding a sense of urgency.

-  **Randomize question order**  
  Shuffle the questions and answer options each time the quiz is played.

- **Store high scores**  
  Save the userâ€™s score using `localStorage` so they can see their best results.

- **Add sound effects**  
  Play a sound when the user selects an answer or completes the quiz.

- **Multi-language support**  
  Let users choose a language (e.g., English or Arabic) for the quiz text.
